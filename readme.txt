## How to Run the Project

1. **Download and Extract**:
   - Download the source code and extract the zip file.
   - Ensure you have all the necessary files and directories.

2. **Local Web Server Setup**:
   - Set up a local web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP) that supports PHP.
   - Configure the server according to your operating system.

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - Create a new database named **sfps_db** in your web server's database management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin).
   - Import the SQL file provided in the database folder of the source code.

4. **Source Code Placement**:
   - Copy and paste the entire source code (PHP files, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to a location accessible by your local web server.
   - For XAMPP users, the default directory is usually **C:\xampp\htdocs**.

5. **Access Your Project**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost/school-fees-payment-system](http://localhost/school-fees-payment-system).
